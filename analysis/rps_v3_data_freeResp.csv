For a while it seemed like let's say I chose rock and the CPU chose scissors and I won. In the next round I would choose paper since the CPU would guess that I would choose scissors since it is not very likely to choose the same one twice in a row and win. I would actually choose paper as it is likely the CPU would choose rock in an effort to beat me when I was supposed to have scissors if that makes sense, it is kind of a weird way of thinking and kind of hard to explain, but it actually worked for quite a few rounds.
