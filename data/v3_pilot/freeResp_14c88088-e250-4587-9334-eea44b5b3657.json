  "free_resp_answer": "I would choose the same object 2 or three times in a row because I was picking up that the opponent chose the same object several times. Once that failed I would choose the object that would beat it the next turn. If we were choosing the same object, I would notice that we would cycle together, so I would assume the next choice would still follow a cycle, so I countered. "
