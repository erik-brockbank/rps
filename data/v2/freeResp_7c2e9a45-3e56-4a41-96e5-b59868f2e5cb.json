  "free_resp_answer": "I noticed that there was a general pattern of the computer going rock, paper, scissors and then repeating that pattern so I simply followed the pattern necessary to beat it. Occasionally the computer would jump to a different position in the pattern but it would then follow the same pattern so I would just adjust my own pattern to match."
