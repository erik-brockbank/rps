  "free_resp_answer": "Initially, I used a strategy of choosing the option that my opponent had previously chosen. This strategy has proven useful in the game if I play it with people in real life. However, my opponent in this game seemed to pick the three options in a certain order, with some brief variance  that would be followed by the same order all over again. This allowed me to beat my opponent without question and large confidence over time."
