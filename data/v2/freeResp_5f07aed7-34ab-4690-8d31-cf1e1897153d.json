  "free_resp_answer": "I would initially choose randomly until at around round 300 I got the oponent into whatr seemed like a loop where we would both choose rock and then he would mostly choose paper after that. If I beat him on that paper, he would often go back to rock and I would tie him again. This got me over 150 points"
