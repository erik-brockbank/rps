  "free_resp_answer": "At first I kep playing moves that I wanted to do, but then I noticed that this was not working. I had to gain a strategy so I decided to alternate from all of the choices. Then I kept losing so then I tried doing the same one over and over and that didnt help. I then tried to look at the number. If it was a loss then I clicked the same one then a win would happen. If it was a tie I then moved to the next one until that one got a win then moved back to the one with a tie. I kept doing this until I finished the game."
