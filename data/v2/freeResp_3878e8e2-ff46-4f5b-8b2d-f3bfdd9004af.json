  "free_resp_answer": "This was frustrating because the score kept resetting. The first time I played i was so close to 300 when i went back to 1/300. It happened a few times and I almost stopped but anyway. I did find a strategy. The opponent kept going in order for the most part so I just had to keep jumping one option ahead each time, and that mostly guaranteed wins."
