  "free_resp_answer": "I figured out a pattern in the opponents choosing and just repeated the winning patter. They went paper, scissor, rock so i went scissor, rock, paper. At first I also thought of the opponent as assuming i kept the same choice what would they choose and base on that what would I choose. Assuming the opponent knew my strategy, if i had chosen rock after the process they would have chosen paper so i would have chosen scissors"
