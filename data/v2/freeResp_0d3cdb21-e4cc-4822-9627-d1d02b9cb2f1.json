  "free_resp_answer": "First I simply tried playing the game by guessing which turn it would make. Than I realized the game had a pattern to it and I simply just followed the pattern after that to get to my goal. The pattern of the opponent was rock, paper, and scissors and they played it in that order so all I had to do was play the winning hand. "
