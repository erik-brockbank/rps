  "free_resp_answer": "I tried to find a pattern between the 3 options and how the opponent response after each turn. Then you can kind of guess the pattern as it repeats itself through a couple turns. After that, it changes again so you will have to figure out the new pattern in order to win a maximum amount of times."
