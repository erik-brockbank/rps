  "free_resp_answer": "The opponents choices were predictable. For that reason if I chose rock In the previous round then my next guess would be to pick paper. Once I chose paper my next guess would be scissors. I would go in that order until the opponent would switch up their guess. When that occurred the order would change but I would still use the same principle. When the opponent would switch up their guess I knew that I would just have to lose that round, but once that round was over I would notice the new start of the pattern explained above. In other words let’s say that if the opponent chose paper out of the blue then I would know that it’s next guess would be scissors. From there I would then choose rock, and I would be correct. Once I chose rock I would then choose paper, and after paper, I would choose scissors! "
