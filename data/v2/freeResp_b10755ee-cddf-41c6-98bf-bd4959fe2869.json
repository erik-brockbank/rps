  "free_resp_answer": "At first, I tried random chance and just chose options at random. After a few tries, I realized it was going in a pattern in order from right to left then chose accordingly. Once the pattern stopped and changed slightly, I stopped the pattern and observed. I ended up staying and choosing the same option over and over when the pattern changed and then acted in response to what I saw."
