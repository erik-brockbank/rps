  "free_resp_answer": "At first I tried to predict the other player's move until I discovered a pattern. Then I found a pattern and stuck with answers to beat that pattern. Eventually, the pattern changed so I once again, tried to predict their choices. It was harder after the first pattern to figure out the new one (if there was one). At one point I thought I figured out the pattern but it seemed to change shortly after. So, I don't know if I just figured out the pattern too late where the pattern changed directly after, or if there wasn't a pattern and it was just random."
