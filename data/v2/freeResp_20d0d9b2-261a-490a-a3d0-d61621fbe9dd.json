  "free_resp_answer": "At first I thought it was completely random until i found out that once I won something for example I played ROCK and they played SCISSORS, I saw it kept going down the line ROCK>PAPER>SCISSORS. But sometimes I would notice that I would tie/lose and I would pay attention to what I played last and why i tied/lost for example I played ROCK and they played PAPER. I would then predict that I should play ROCK again because they will play SCISSORS next."
