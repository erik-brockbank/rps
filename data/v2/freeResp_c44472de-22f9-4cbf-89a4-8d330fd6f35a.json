  "free_resp_answer": "After a couple rounds I noticed that for the majority of the game my opponent went in order, i.e scissors then paper then rock, and would continue to repeat that pattern. After noticing the pattern I just simply selected the counter since they were demonstrating an obvious choice pattern.\n\nAfter about every 10 rounds, I noticed that my opponent would re-select the object from the previous round. Unfortunately, I could not capitalize because I only noticed that pattern during the final rounds."
