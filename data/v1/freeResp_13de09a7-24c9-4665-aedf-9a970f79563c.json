  "free_resp_answer": "I used the mouse with my left hand, and I show the moves with my right hand. \nAlso, I would try to play it with a real person by adapting my normal reaction and prediction to the player. \nIf I got the round wrong, I would look back and see what the other player chose to predict what the player would click next time. On the other hand, I would play around with my choices if I got the previous round right."
