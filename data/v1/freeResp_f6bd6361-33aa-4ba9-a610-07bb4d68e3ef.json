  "free_resp_answer": "At first, I was mindlessly guessing as if I was playing just for fun in real life. Then I remembered that the instructions said it was a memory test, so I tried memorizing the opponent's moves and then guessing to find the pattern. However, once the pattern was different for more than 10 moves successively, I just went with my gut. Halfway through, I started to try and just match the moves to get 0 points unless I thought I for sure knew my opponent's next move, then I would try and win."
