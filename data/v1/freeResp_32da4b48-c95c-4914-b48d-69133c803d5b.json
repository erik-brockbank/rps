  "free_resp_answer": "1. Patterns - lull them into doing 2-2-2 and then around 2/3 of the time i win or 0 pts, then guranteed win on the 7th cause I do something out of order\n2. If I notice them doing something or me winning with a certain card I predict the prediction. I.e winning with scissors, they might try doing rock but then I switch to paper. It's really easy to bait wins that way when they think I'mma spam scissors for a 3rd or 4th time."
