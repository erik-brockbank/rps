  "free_resp_answer": "I just randomly chose at the beginning, but like after 200 games I can see the opponent strategy that the guy never repeat the same thing. For example, if he used rock then the next will be either scissors or paper most likely. So I chose scissors in order to either win or draw. I was losing until like 200 games but after that I won most of them."
