  "free_resp_answer": "I usually keep playing paper for a few rounds to see what the opponent is playing, then if I realized a pattern, then I would purposefully choose something that beats her. While there were times that the opponent was able to guess what I play, I was able to win the opponent after a few rounds when I pay attention and think strategically what to play. Overall, I usually just focus on what she plays when I lose in order to predict what I should play and win. "
