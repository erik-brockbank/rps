  "free_resp_answer": "In the beginning, I wanted to set my strategy as explicitly as possible, so more often than not, choosing paper or rock, an that caused my opponent to choose more often \"scissors\". After a certain point, I began to think about tendencies and options my opponent gravitated towards, and adjust my strategy to shake them up. Once I felt that I may have lost predictability to my opponent, I began to try and think deeper as to how much more unpredictable I can be, and started to choose options I didn't think I would choose."
