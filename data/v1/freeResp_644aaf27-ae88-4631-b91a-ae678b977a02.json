  "free_resp_answer": "Very interesting, sometimes it was really interesting to play with, infuriating when you are on a losing streak and a few moments where I had to guess what the opponent was going to put down.\nIf the person lost with scissors and I used rock, they would tend to play the third choice \"paper\". But when they win for example with scissor, they tend to use the same move."
