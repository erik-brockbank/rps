  "free_resp_answer": "I noticed my opponent would do the same thing a couple of round so I would see what they were doing and how I could counteract. I also knew they would change their approach after loosing a few times, so I should change mine and try to guess their next pick.  I was doing really well the first half, but then I think they caught on to me and ended up getting ahead of me."
