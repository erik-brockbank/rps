  "free_resp_answer": "I know about how people tend to subconsciously choose whatever will beat the opponent's last move, so in reverse I tried to choose whatever would have lost to the opponent's last move. However, that didn't really work, so I just started clicking things at random and hoping for the best. When that didn't work either, I stopped looking at the opponent's side and just clicked whatever I felt like pressing at random. That also did not work. I lost by a landslide, and it was a little embarrassing. "
