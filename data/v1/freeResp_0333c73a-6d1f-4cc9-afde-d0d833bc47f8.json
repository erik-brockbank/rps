  "free_resp_answer": "I was trying to make a guess as to what their next choice would be based off how many other times they had used the other choices in the recent rounds. Also I would choose one choice several times to try and trick them into thinking I would choose it again, but I think they also did this to me. Sometimes i felt my prediction of their next choice was spot on, other times i felt as if they had predicted my own prediction."
