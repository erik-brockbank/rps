  "free_resp_answer": "I tried to determine which strategy the computer used, and initially the last move I played would determine which move it would play. (For example, if I played rock, its next move would be paper.) Then I questioned whether the computer would anticipate two moves ahead of my last played move. (For example, if I played rock, it would predict that I would play scissors with the expectation that it would play scissors.) Ultimately, I was not able to determine the correct pattern of action implemented by the computer. I do believe that it would repeat the same move if we ended in a draw up to two times in a row. "
