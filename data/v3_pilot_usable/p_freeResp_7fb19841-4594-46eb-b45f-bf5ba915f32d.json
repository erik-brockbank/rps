  "free_resp_answer": "I would usually try to assume that the opponent thinks I'll do a repeat and beat what would beat my previous throw (ex I just threw rock so maybe I'll throw scissors to foil paper in case they think I throw rock again). There were multiple instances where I just repeated what I threw, to see if the opponent would continue playing the same throw and losing (ex me throwing scissors repeatedly vs their paper)."
