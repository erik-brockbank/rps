  "free_resp_answer": "I tried to predict the moves of the other person based on the outcome of the current game. So if I chose, paper and they chose rock, I win. Considering this, they would adjust their choice by choosing paper, then I would adjust my choice to be the scissors, in which case, I beat my opponent again. Sometimes, I saw a pattern to their moves so I would try to go one step ahead of them. For example, in our current game, I would pick scissors and they would pick rock, in which case, I lose. I guessed that in the next round they would use rock again because they won with that, in which case, I would adjust my move to be paper, so I can win. "
