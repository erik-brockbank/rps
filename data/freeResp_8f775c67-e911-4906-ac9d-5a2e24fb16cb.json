  "free_resp_answer": "Over time I learned that if I put either rock, paper, or scissors, my opponent would repeat my choice. For example, if I put rock my opponent would expect me to put rock again and they would put paper so I would put scissors instead. I learned that there is an expectation in this game and you need to learn what your opponent expects so you can do something differently and win. "
