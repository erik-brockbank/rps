  "free_resp_answer": "I did not really have too much of a strategy. I sort of guessed for most part of the game. But at some times I did see almost a pattern depending on what the opponent previously guessed - or at least I thought I did. So if they used \"rock\" I would do \"scissors\" because maybe they think I am going to pick \"paper\" if they use \"rock\" again. The scissors would be least expected. "
