  "free_resp_answer": "I would look for some sort of pattern my opponent was doing, and I kept doing it until I lost. When I won, I maintained my strategy, whether it be spamming one move or choosing the moves on a specific cycle, until I lost. When I lost I usually chose the one my opponent beat me with to figure out a pattern I could abuse. I kept repeating this and I eventually got a massive point lead compared to the AI."
