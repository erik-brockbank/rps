  "free_resp_answer": "I just considered for the patterns. It seemed that the opponent did not use \"papers\" a lot, while it used \"rocks\" and \"scissors\" many times. Therefore, I usually avoided using \"papers\", and sometimes avoided \"rocks\" in case the opponent used \"rocks\" and \"scissors\"."
