  "free_resp_answer": "most of the time, I picked the option that countered the opponent's last choice. If I tied with the opponent, I would try to tie with them the next few times, then would randomly choose the winning card when I think the opponent doesn't expect me to stop tying with them. Sometimes I would do the same card they just played or the same card over and over again to try to confuse them."
