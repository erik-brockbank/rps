  "free_resp_answer": "I realized there was a pattern to my opponent's playing style. Also I noticed that when I chose either rock, paper, or scissors, copying their choice in the previous round, there was a higher chance of me winning the following round. I also would also try to get more ties, in which I don't lose any points and my opponent wouldn't gain. I played the \"safe\" game rather than trying to win each round."
