  "free_resp_answer": "For most of the rounds I was able to try and think two steps ahead of what I thought my opponent's next move would be in response to what I had just played. For some of them I noticed that if we kept putting down the same card it was a safe bet to stick with that card or to try and mix it up a little by adding the card that would beat the card that we were both consistently putting down."
