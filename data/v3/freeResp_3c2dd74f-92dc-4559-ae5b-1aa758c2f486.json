  "free_resp_answer": "I once played this online game with friends where one of the mini-games was rock-paper-scissors, and one of his strategies was just throwing the most \"powerful one\" the entire time, so I threw rock a bunch of times to see what would happen. I also attempted to see if there was a pattern that it was going by, but I got confused midway and would think about what I threw instead. I also strangely thought of the opponent as an actual human who might think things like \"Well, If I've thrown a rock 2-3 times, they'll assume I'm going to throw a rock again, so I should throw something opposite of it\", which, maybe I imagined it, seemed to work, because I would choose the opposite weapon and win a couple of times. Other than that, it really felt like pure luck."
