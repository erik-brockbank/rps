  "free_resp_answer": "At first I didn't pay much attention to the different patterns... Then when I saw that there was a certain pattern that the opponent was taking I would counter it.  I noticed it would either move from one side to the other or vice versa.  Sometimes it would fixate on a specific option for about 5-8 times and then switch one over in the order.  It seemed to repeat a specific pattern with the rock at one point where it would be on the rock about 6 times and then move right.  "
