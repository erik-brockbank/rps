  "free_resp_answer": "At first, I tried thinking one step ahead but my opponent was doing the same thing. When I tried not thinking ahead, it didn't work. At one point I realized going in a pattern (rock, paper scissors or scissors, paper, rock) was winning. I did that for the second half of the trials. When it stopped working, I combined that with random choices."
