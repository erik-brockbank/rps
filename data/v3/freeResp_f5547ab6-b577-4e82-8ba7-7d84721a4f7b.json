  "free_resp_answer": "I noticed sometimes there would a pattern where we kept choosing from left to right so i would do that for two rounds and then instead of clicking the third button (sissors), I would click the button that would allow me to win which would be rock. Also, sometimes they repeated the same choice when they beat me with it so whenever I lost, I would click the option that would kill the option they would repeat, so if the kept clicking rock,I would click paper.
