  "free_resp_answer": "At first, I picked at random because it is a game of chance essentially. But after a bit, I started noticing a bit of a pattern in the other person's moves, like which ones they tended to pick following another move. That's how I managed to win the game because I paid attention to it. Other than that, there really was no strategy involved"
