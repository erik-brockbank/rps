  "free_resp_answer": "There was usually a pattern in which the opponent would either choose the same thing for 4 or 5 rounds or it would go clockwise or counterclockwise between the choices and so I figured out which pattern it was using to make a prediction about what it was going to pick next and then I picked the one that would beat it."
