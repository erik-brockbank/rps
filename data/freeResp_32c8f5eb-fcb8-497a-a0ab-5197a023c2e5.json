  "free_resp_answer": "I noticed that there was a pattern to the opponent's plays... I didn't get the whole pattern as it seemed to switch up a bit, but there were periods of time where the opponent's plays went in order (as the cards were presented) so I could predict the next move and choose accordingly. There were also multiple instances where \"paper\" or \"scissors\" was selected repeatedly by the opponent, so I was able to recognize that I should just keep clicking the respective winning card in these instances until the opponent changed to a different pattern.
