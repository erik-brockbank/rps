  "free_resp_answer": "At first I thought it was an AI so I just randomly guessed. Then I realized the opponent needed time to make a choice so I tested if the opponent was another person. Also because 7 other people came to the study with me. I delayed my choice long enough and kept picking the same choice again to confirm my suspicions. Apparently I was right, so I tried to get the opponent to score: 420. Unfortunately they only cooperated for a little bit and we were not able to reach 420. Sorry if I messed around with your experiment."
